I recently watched an issue of the CBS show [Scorpion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion_(TV_series)), about a group of four "geniuses" who solve problems for the government and it got me thinking about my childhood. 

Now, I know, it's a show, it's not "real," but there was something about the show that grabbed me: it spoke about the loneliness and "damage" that often afflicts super-smart people. In fact, one characters to another character about her young son who is having trouble in school and relating to other people: "I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but your son is a genius." 

Lots of people have ideas about what it's like to be a genius, some right, mostly wrong. In this blog I will be discussing my own thoughts and history on the topic.
